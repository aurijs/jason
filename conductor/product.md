# Initial Concept
A simple, lightweight, and embeddable JSON document database built on Bun.

# Product Vision: JasonDB
JasonDB aims to be the premier JSON database for the Bun ecosystem, bridging the gap between simple local storage and enterprise-grade distributed systems. It provides a developer-centric experience without compromising on the reliability and performance required for production-scale applications.

## Target Audience
- **Bun Developers:** Creators building lightweight applications who require a zero-config, high-performance embedded database.
- **Frontend Engineers:** Developers needing a robust, type-safe mock database for local development, prototyping, and testing.
- **System Architects:** Infrastructure leads seeking a lightweight core for building distributed, highly-available JSON storage solutions.

## Core Goals & Value Propositions
- **Developer-First Experience:** A minimal API designed for maximum productivity in TypeScript/Bun environments.
- **Uncompromising Reliability:** Built-in schema validation, versioning, and ACID-compliant concurrency control to protect data integrity.
- **Scalability by Design:** Engineered to evolve from a local embedded file system to a distributed, high-throughput environment.

## Key Features
- **TypeScript Integration:** First-class support for types and runtime schema validation.
- **Concurrency & Versioning:** Robust conflict resolution and document history tracking.
- **Scale-Ready Architecture:** Designed to support future distributed synchronization and high-availability patterns.

## 12-Month Success Metrics
- **Bun Ecosystem Leadership:** Establish JasonDB as a recognized standard in the Bun community.
- **Feature Parity & Excellence:** Achieve full feature parity with established embedded databases while maintaining a superior performance profile on Bun.
