# Product Guidelines: JasonDB

These guidelines define the communication style, brand messaging, and visual identity for JasonDB to ensure consistency across documentation, marketing, and the developer experience.

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional & Engineering-Focused:** Our communication is direct, precise, and technical. We prioritize clarity and accuracy, focusing on architectural integrity, performance metrics, and reliability.
- **Authoritative yet Accessible:** We speak as experts in the Bun ecosystem, providing clear guidance without unnecessary jargon, assuming a high level of competence from our users.

## Brand Messaging
- **Core Tagline:** "Slash database complexity away with jason."
- **Key Pillars:**
    - **Native Bun Integration:** Highlighting that JasonDB is built specifically for and on Bun.
    - **Reliability First:** Emphasizing schema validation and concurrency control as foundational features.
    - **Simplicity at Scale:** Positioning the tool as easy to start with, yet robust enough for complex architectural needs.

## Visual Identity & Design Principles
- **Modern Minimalism:** Our documentation and brand assets use ample whitespace and clean, modern sans-serif typography to communicate that the library is "lightweight."
- **Schema-First Visualization:** We treat code blocks and technical diagrams as primary design elements. Complex concepts are explained through well-structured schemas and architectural flowcharts rather than long prose.
- **Professional Accents:** We use a focused color palette with subtle accents to highlight key technical information, maintaining a clean and focused "dev-tool" aesthetic.
